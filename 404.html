NASA\u0026rsquo;s Dawn mission, together with the International Astronomical Union, established that craters on Ceres would be named for agricultural deities from all over the world, and other features would be named for agricultural festivals. Ceres itself was named after the Roman goddess of corn and harvests by its discoverer, Giuseppe Piazzi, who spotted it with his telescope in 1801. Since March 2015, Dawn has been orbiting Ceres and sending back many intriguing images and other data about its features.\nUsing suggestions from the Dawn team, the IAU recently approved 25 new Ceres feature names tied to theme of agricultural deities, marked in yellow on the map. Emesh Crater, for example, is named for the Sumerian god of vegetation and agriculture. Jumi is the Latvian god of fertility of the field.\nThe newly named surface features vary in size. Thrud, for example, is a crater with a diameter of 4.8 miles (7.8 kilometers) within the larger crater Zadeni, while Mlezi has a diameter of 28 miles (42 kilometers).\nFor more information, the characteristics of these and other features on Ceres can be found in the IAU\u0026rsquo;s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20126 Researchers from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Dawn mission have composed the first comprehensive views of the north (left) and south pole regions (right) of dwarf planet Ceres, using images obtained by the Dawn spacecraft. The images were taken between Aug. 17 and Oct. 23, 2015, from an altitude of 915 miles (1,470 kilometers).\nThe region around the south pole appears black in this view because this area has been in shade ever since Dawn\u0026rsquo;s arrival on March 6, 2015, and is therefore not visible.\nAt the north polar region, craters Jarovit, Ghanan and Asari are visible, as well as the mountain Ysolo Mons. Near the south pole, craters Attis and Zadeni can be seen.\nDetailed maps of the polar regions allow researchers to study the craters in this area and compare them to those covering other parts of Ceres. Variations in shape and complexity can point to different surface compositions. In addition, the bottoms of some craters located close to the poles receive no sunlight throughout Ceres\u0026rsquo; orbit around the sun. Scientists want to investigate whether surface ice can be found there.\nQuadrangles The definition of the quadrangles, prefixed Ac, is paywalled here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103516306637 However, another article (\u0026ldquo;A Cartographic Perspective on the Planetary Geologic Mapping Investigation of Ceres\u0026rdquo;, https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/17/4209 , backup ) offers this map:\nand this geological map:\nImages Dawn mission: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/galleries/images ",

        "content": "Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) Maps Europa has a geological map and defined quadrangles.\nUSGS Map https://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2757/ NOTES ON BASE This sheet is one in a series of maps of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter at a nominal scale of 1:15,000,000. This series is based on data from the Galileo Orbiter Solid-State Imaging (SSI) camera and the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.\nPROJECTION Mercator and Polar Stereographic projections used for this map of Europa are based on a sphere having a radius of 1,562.09 km. The scale is 1:8,388,000 at ±56° latitude for both projections. Longitude increases to the west in accordance with the International Astronomical Union (1971; Davies and others, 1996). Latitude is planetographic.\nCONTROL The process of creating a geometric control network began with selecting control points on the individual images, making pixel measurements of their locations, using reseau locations to correct for geometric distortions, and converting the measurements to millimeters in the focal plane. These data are combined with the camera focal lengths and navigation solutions as input to a photogrammetric triangulation solution (Davies and others, 1998; Davies and Katayama, 1981). The solution used here was computed at the RAND Corporation in June 2000. Solved parameters include the radius (given above) of the best-fitting sphere, the coordinates of the con- trol points, the three orientation angles of the camera at each exposure (right ascension, declination, and twist), and an angle (W0) that defines the orientation of Europa in space. W0—in this solution 36.022°—is the angle along the equator to the east, between the 0° meridian and the equator’s intersection with the celestial equator at the standard epoch J2000.0. This solution places the crater Cilix at its defined longitude of 182° west (Davies and others, 1996).\nMAPPING TECHNIQUE This global map base uses the best image quality and moderate resolution coverage supplied by Galileo SSI and Voyager 1 and 2 (Batson, 1987; Becker and others, 1998; 1999; 2001). The digital map was produced using Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) (Eliason, 1997; Gaddis and others, 1997; Torson and Becker, 1997). The individual images were radiometrically calibrated and photometrically normalized using a Lunar-Lambert function with empirically derived values (McEwen, 1991; Kirk and others, 2000). A linear correction based on the statistics of all overlapping areas was then applied to minimize image brightness varia- tions. The image data were selected on the basis of overall image quality, reasonable original input resolution (from 20 km/pixel for gap fill to as much as 40 m/pixel), and availability of moderate emission/incidence angles for topography and albedo. Although consistency was achieved where possible, different filters were included for global image coverage as necessary: clear/blue for Voyager 1 and 2; clear, near-IR (757 nm), and green (559 nm) for Galileo SSI. Individual images were projected to a Sinusoidal Equal-Area projection at an image resolution of 500 m/pixel. The final constructed Sinusoidal projection mosaic was then reprojected to the Mercator and Polar Stereographic projections included on this sheet.\nNOMENCLATURE Names on this sheet are approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU, 1980, 1986, 1999, and 2001). Names have been applied for features clearly visible at the scale of this map; for a complete list of nomenclature of Europa, please see http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov . Font color was chosen only for readability.\nQuadrangles (Je): Quadrangles as defined but unnamed: https://solarviews.com/eng/eurmap.htm Other resources https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234039235_Geologic_mapping_of_Europa Sky Europa is tidally locked with Jupiter, so Jupiter never moves in the sky and it\u0026rsquo;s visible only on Europe\u0026rsquo;s emisphere that faces it.\nFrom Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Orbit_and_rotation :\nEuropa orbits Jupiter in just over three and a half days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900 km. With an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa\u0026rsquo;s surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa\u0026rsquo;s prime meridian (0 longitude) is a line passing through this point.\nRemember also that:\nApparent size / 3438 arcminutes = Diameter (km) / Distance (km)\nConsidering this, the height of Jupiter in the sky is equivalent to the latitude-longitude coordinates of any given point, flipped. For example at 10°S 5°E, Jupiter appears in the sky close to the zenith, at 10°N 5°W. Past 90°E/W, Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s center is below the horizon, but it\u0026rsquo;s partially visible for a few more degrees (half of its apparent diameter).\nJupiter\u0026rsquo;s apparent diameter is 13.4° wide when seen from Europa: Jupiter has a diameter of 142,000 km, Europa has a diameter of 2960 km, and distance varies between 604,000 and 592,000 km.\nLeading/trailing hemisphere The leading hemisphere is the one facing the direction of motion of the moon while orbiting Jupiter. The trailing hemisphere is its opposite. So the \u0026ldquo;subjovian\u0026rdquo; hemisphere overlaps for 90° with the western half of the trailing hemisphere and for 90° with the eastern half of the leading hemisphere.\nImage of Europa\u0026rsquo;s trailing emisphere. North up. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00502 This image shows two views of the trailing hemisphere of Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s ice-covered satellite, Europa. The left image shows the approximate natural color appearance of Europa. The image on the right is a false-color composite version combining violet, green and infrared images to enhance color differences in the predominantly water-ice crust of Europa. Dark brown areas represent rocky material derived from the interior, implanted by impact, or from a combination of interior and exterior sources. Bright plains in the polar areas (top and bottom) are shown in tones of blue to distinguish possibly coarse-grained ice (dark blue) from fine-grained ice (light blue). Long, dark lines are fractures in the crust, some of which are more than 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) long. The bright feature containing a central dark spot in the lower third of the image is a young impact crater some 50 kilometers (31 miles) in diameter. This crater has been provisionally named \u0026ldquo;Pwyll\u0026rdquo; for the Celtic god of the underworld.\nEuropa is about 3,160 kilometers (1,950 miles) in diameter, or about the size of Earth\u0026rsquo;s moon. This image was taken on September 7, 1996, at a range of 677,000 kilometers (417,900 miles) by the solid state imaging television camera onboard the Galileo spacecraft during its second orbit around Jupiter. The image was processed by Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luftund Raumfahrt e.V., Berlin, Germany.\nCrater on the right is Pwyll, the one on the right Callanish, the spot right under the wide crossing lineae is Conamara Chaos.\nJupiter from various locations Callanish Crater 16.70°S 25.5°E (Je-10 \u0026ldquo;Callanish\u0026rdquo;, quadrangle name arbitrary). It\u0026rsquo;s still fully in the trailing hemisphere and Jupiter is fully visible, high in the sky at slightly north-west. https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/974 Conamara Chaos 9.70°N 87.3°E (Je-09 \u0026ldquo;Belus Linea\u0026rdquo;, quadrangle name arbitrary). Jupiter is sitting slightly southward on the western horizon, half visible. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conamara_Chaos https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1282 Kennet Linea 41°S 48°E. Consider that, being a Linea, the center coordinates don\u0026rsquo;t mean much. However, from the specified point, Jupiter is well visible and high in the sky, equally far between the zenith and the horizon in both directions. https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2988 Phases of Jupiter Knowing that Europa it tidally locked, phases are opposite: at midday Jupiter is dark and a solar eclipse occurs, while at night Jupiter is full. The day/month on Europa lasts ~84h, so ~3.5 days.\nNearly Midday: Aperture 90°. Generated with NASA\u0026rsquo;s simulator https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/ Nearly Midnight: Aperture 90°. Generated with NASA\u0026rsquo;s simulator https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/ Surface Radioactivity From Wikipedia:\nThe ionizing radiation level at Europa\u0026rsquo;s surface is equivalent to a daily dose of about 5.4 Sv (540 rem)[\u0026ldquo;The New Solar System\u0026rdquo;, 1999, see the books], an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single Earth day (24 hours).\nAlso this page for reference: https://web.archive.org/web/20080725050708/http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~fringwal/w08a.jup.txt :\nSatellites have spacings similar to Bode\u0026rsquo;s Law: really miniature Solar Systems. All have fierce, vicious magnetospheres! Doses: Callisto: 0.01 rem/day, Ganymede: 8 rem/day, Europa: 540 rem/day, Io: 3600 rem/day, Thebe and inner satellites: 18,000 rem/day!\nAnother reference from the Europa Lander project: 2.0 Mrad radiation exposure https://web.archive.org/web/20190924151217/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/web/absscicon/02-AbsSciCon-Mission-Overview-13Jun2019-no-BU.pdf Article: https://europa.nasa.gov/news/17/radiation-maps-of-europa-key-to-future-missions/ It seems like the equatorial zone is much more radioactive than the poles (pink zones).\nPhosphorescence Europa is phosphorescent because of its radioactivity: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/europa-glows-radiation-does-a-bright-number-on-jupiters-moon ( Backup )\nAs the icy, ocean-filled moon Europa orbits Jupiter, it withstands a relentless pummeling of radiation. Jupiter zaps Europa’s surface night and day with electrons and other particles, bathing it in high-energy radiation. But as these particles pound the moon’s surface, they may also be doing something otherworldly: making Europa glow in the dark.\nNew research from scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California details for the first time what the glow would look like, and what it could reveal about the composition of ice on Europa’s surface. Different salty compounds react differently to the radiation and emit their own unique glimmer. To the naked eye, this glow would look sometimes slightly green, sometimes slightly blue or white and with varying degrees of brightness, depending on what material it is.\nScientists use a spectrometer to separate the light into wavelengths and connect the distinct “signatures,” or spectra, to different compositions of ice. Most observations using a spectrometer on a moon like Europa are taken using reflected sunlight on the moon’s dayside, but these new results illuminate what Europa would look like in the dark. [\u0026hellip;]\nScientists have inferred from prior observations that Europa’s surface could be made of a mix of ice and commonly known salts on Earth, such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) and sodium chloride (table salt). The new research shows that incorporating those salts into water ice under Europa-like conditions and blasting it with radiation produces a glow.\nThat much was not a surprise. It’s easy to imagine an irradiated surface glowing. [\u0026hellip;] “But we never imagined that we would see what we ended up seeing,” said JPL’s Bryana Henderson, who co-authored the research. “When we tried new ice compositions, the glow looked different. And we all just stared at it for a while and then said, ‘This is new, right? This is definitely a different glow?’ So we pointed a spectrometer at it, and each type of ice had a different spectrum.”\nNote that at the time of the article (2020), no mission observed this glow yet. It\u0026rsquo;s a lab prediction.\nPenitentes Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation) Penitentes, or nieves penitentes (Spanish for \u0026ldquo;penitent snows\u0026rdquo;), are snow formations found at high altitudes. They take the form of elongated, thin blades of hardened snow or ice, closely spaced and pointing towards the general direction of the sun. [\u0026hellip;]\nThese spires of snow and ice grow over all glaciated and snow-covered areas in the Dry Andes above 4,000 metres (13,000 ft). They range in length from a few centimetres to over 5 metres (16 ft) [on Earth]. [\u0026hellip;]\nPenitentes up to 15 metres (49 ft) high are suggested to be present in the tropics zone on Europa, a satellite of Jupiter.\nArticle: https://www.space.com/42051-jupiter-moon-europa-ice-towers-lander.html ( Backup )\nEquatorial regions of the potentially life-supporting Europa, which harbors a huge ocean of salty liquid water beneath its icy shell, are probably studded with blades of ice up to 50 feet (15 meters) tall, a new study suggests. [\u0026hellip;] \u0026ldquo;Clearly, the paper suggests very strongly that the tropics of Europa are going to be spiky, and it would be unwise to plan to land there without a specially adapted lander,\u0026rdquo; study lead author Dan Hobley, a lecturer in the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Cardiff University in Wales, told Space.com via email. \u0026ldquo;It would probably be safer to land further away from the equator!\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no reason to believe this process is restricted to our planet. Indeed, scientists think the \u0026ldquo;bladed terrain\u0026rdquo; spotted on Pluto by NASA\u0026rsquo;s New Horizons spacecraft likely consists of penitentes carved into methane ice.\nEuropa would seem to a good bet for penitente gardens as well; after all, it\u0026rsquo;s a cold, dry, virtually air-free world that\u0026rsquo;s entirely covered in ice. So Hobley and his colleagues calculated sublimation rates around the surface of the Jupiter moon and then compared those with the rates of other erosional processes. Those processes include bombardment by meteoroids and charged particles from Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s powerful radiation belts.\nThe researchers found sublimation to be the dominant factor on equatorial Europa, the regions within 23 degrees of the moon\u0026rsquo;s equator. And sublimation has likely carved penitentes into the ice there, the study team determined. These are some serious putative penitentes, too: some fields could feature towers up to 50 feet (15 m) tall, spaced about 23 feet (7 m) apart, the scientists found. Here on Earth, penitente heights typically range from 3 to 16 feet (1 to 5 m).\nOriginal article: s41561-018-0235-0 Note that at the time of the article (2018), no mission observed penitentes on Europa yet. It\u0026rsquo;s a prediction.\nLineae Lineae are relatively thin. From available pictures they seem to be about 2km wide, the equivalent of 30min walking or 10-15mins running.\nNote: this is not the time it would take to cross the same distance on Europa. The terrain is likely really harsh (see Penitentes) and there are slopes. On top of it the gravity is moon-like, which severely affects balance even in normal conditions, and the ground is made of salty ice, which makes is very slippery. The most likely \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; method of moving on the surface is some sort of \u0026ldquo;skating\u0026rdquo; where flat, and honestly I have no idea what in the case of blades. Probably one would need to jump over them. At that gravity, jumping is slow and best done horizontally. Etc etc. I should summarize the difficulties of moving in a low gravity, ragged icy surface in another page.\nExample: 15ESREGMAP01 (Galileo mosaic from https://www.planetary.org/space-images/lineae-on-europa , original source likely here but dead). Shows Minos Linea https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/3915 and Udaeus Linea https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/6183 .\nLineae and lenticulae on Europa. This mosaic of Galileo SSI images from 1998 and 1999 runs from Mehen Linea at the top of the frame, across the intersection of Minos and Udaeus Lineae, and finally to the lenticulated terrain northwest of Dyfed Regio. The resolution of this mosaic is 228 meters per pixel. (NASA / JPL / Jason Perry)\nThe lineae thickness is about 16-20px overall, which sums up to 4km wide in the widest possible point I could find. Consider also that these are among the widest lineae I could locate on the map. Kennet, for comparison, is thinner.\nGeysers Article: https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-europa-water-vapor ( Backup )\nPrevious scientific findings from other sources already point to the existence of an ocean located under Europa\u0026rsquo;s icy crust. Researchers are not yet fully certain whether the detected water vapor is generated by erupting water plumes on the surface, but they are confident this is the most likely explanation. [\u0026hellip;]\nHubble spectroscopic observations provided the evidence for Europa plumes in December 2012. Time sampling of Europa\u0026rsquo;s auroral emissions measured by Hubble\u0026rsquo;s imaging spectrograph enabled the researchers to distinguish between features created by charged particles from Jupiter\u0026rsquo;s magnetic bubble and plumes from Europa\u0026rsquo;s surface, and also to rule out more exotic explanations such as serendipitously observing a rare meteorite impact.\nThe imaging spectrograph detected faint ultraviolet light from an aurora, powered by Jupiter’s intense magnetic field, near the moon’s south pole. Excited atomic oxygen and hydrogen produce a variable auroral glow and leave a telltale sign that are the products of water molecules being broken apart by electrons along magnetic field lines.\n“We pushed Hubble to its limits to see this very faint emission. These could be stealth plumes, because they might be tenuous and difficult to observe in the visible light,” said Joachim Saur of the University of Cologne, Germany. Saur, who is principal investigator of the Hubble observation campaign, co-wrote the paper with Roth. He suggested that long cracks on Europa’s surface, known as lineae, might be venting water vapor into space. Cassini has seen similar fissures that host the Enceladus jets.\nAlso the Hubble team found that the intensity of the Europa plumes, like those at Enceladus, varies with Europa’s orbital position. Active jets have only been seen when the moon is farthest from Jupiter. The researchers could not detect any sign of venting when Europa is closer to Jupiter.\nOne explanation for the variability is that these lineae experience more stress as gravitational tidal forces push and pull on the moon and open vents at larger distances from Jupiter. The vents are narrowed or closed when the moon is closest to the gas-giant planet. \u0026ldquo;The apparent plume variability supports a key prediction that Europa should tidally flex by a significant amount if it has a subsurface ocean,\u0026rdquo; said Kurt Retherford, also of Southwest Research Institute.\nThe Europa and Enceladus plumes have remarkably similar abundances of water vapor. Because Europa has a roughly 12 times stronger gravitational pull than Enceladus, the minus-40-degree-Fahrenheit (minus-40-degree-Celsius) vapor for the most part doesn’t escape into space as it does at Enceladus, but rather falls back onto the surface after reaching an altitude of 125 miles (201 kilometers), according to the Hubble measurements. This could leave bright surface features near the moon’s south polar region, the researchers hypothesize.\nNote also here that at the time of the article (2013), this is a prediction based on Hubble observations and parallels with Enceladus. Direct observations on Europa are still weak.\nAccording to Wikipedia new studies based on the same data seems to confirm the same.\n",

        "content": "Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) Maps Quadrangles Titan\u0026rsquo;s quadrangles haven\u0026rsquo;t been defined at the time of writing. We can assume that they should be named \u0026ldquo;St\u0026rdquo; can be inferred from the other jovian and saturnian moons such as Europa (Je), Ganymede (Jg), Enceladus (Se)\u0026hellip; So Titan should be St.\nRegarding the quadrangles definition, I overlapped the traditional division into 15 quadrangles of the Jovian moons (and other moons/small planets) found here: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19930001644/downloads/19930001644.pdf ( backup ) with a map of the main albedo features known to date.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20713 This map of Titan shows the names of many (but not all) features on the Saturnian moon that have been approved by the International Astronomical Union. The map shows Cassini imaging coverage of Titan as of June 2015 (previously published as PIA19658).\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19657 The northern and southern hemispheres of Titan are seen in these polar stereographic maps, assembled in 2015 using the best-available images of the giant Saturnian moon from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini mission. The images were taken by Cassini\u0026rsquo;s imaging cameras using a spectral filter centered at 938 nanometers, allowing researchers to examine variations in albedo (or inherent brightness) across the surface of Titan. These maps utilize imaging data collected through Cassini\u0026rsquo;s flyby on April 7, 2014, known as \u0026ldquo;T100.\u0026rdquo;\nTitan\u0026rsquo;s north pole was not well illuminated early in Cassini\u0026rsquo;s mission, because it was winter in the northern hemisphere when the spacecraft arrived at Saturn. Cassini has been better able to observe northern latitudes in more recent years due to seasonal changes in solar illumination. Compared to the previous version of Cassini\u0026rsquo;s north polar map (see PIA11146), this map provides much more detail and fills in a large area of missing data. The imaging data in these maps complement Cassini synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mapping of Titan\u0026rsquo;s north pole (see PIA17655).\nThe uniform gray area in the northern hemisphere indicates a gap in the imaging coverage of Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface, to date. The missing data will be imaged by Cassini during flybys on December 15, 2016 and March 5, 2017.\nLakes are also seen in the southern hemisphere map, but they are much less common than in the north polar region. Only a lakes have been confirmed in the south. The dark, footprint-shaped feature at 180 degrees west is Ontario Lacus; a smaller lake named Crveno Lacus can be seen as a very dark spot just above Ontario. The dark-albedo area seen at the top of the southern hemisphere map (at 0 degrees west) is an area called Mezzoramia.\nEach map is centered on one of the poles, and surface coverage extends southward to 60 degrees latitude. Grid lines indicate latitude in 10-degree increments and longitude in 30-degree increments. The scale in the full-size versions of these maps is 4,600 feet (1,400 meters) per pixel. The mean radius of Titan used for projection of these maps is 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\nSo for example the North Pole is clearly in St-01, while features like Adiri is split between St-09 and St-08. Regaridng the names, St-08\u0026rsquo;s main feature is the dark patch Belet, St-09 contains primarily Shangri-La, so the names could be picked easily. However, St-01 contains three \u0026ldquo;seas\u0026rdquo;: Kraken, Ligeia and Punga. Kraken is the biggest, but its center is technically outside of the St-01 quadrangle (located at 68°N, while St-01 ends at 66°N), so the next reasonable choice is Ligeia.\nSummary:\nSt-01 Ligeia: 180-65°N, 0-360°E\nSt-08 Belet: 22°N-22°S, 288-216°E\nSt-09 Shangri-la: 22°N-22°S, 216-144°E\nSky Brightness The high Titan atmosphere is opaque to visible light. Therefore, the sky of Titan is constantly covered by what looks like a cover of thick clouds and the brightness, even during daytime, is quite similar to what one would see during a storm or indoors.\nArticle: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aae519 ( Backup )\n\u0026ldquo;Sky brightness and viewing conditions are expected to be quite different from Earth and Mars due to Titan\u0026rsquo;s farther distance from the Sun ( 10 AU) and complex haze layers in its atmosphere. The sky brightness model videos show what a typical sunny day may look like standing on the surface of Titan based on radiative transfer models.\nFor astronauts who see with visible light, the daytime sky has a distinctly dark orange color and appears uniform in all directions due to significant Mie scattering from the many high-altitude haze layers. The daytime sky is calculated to be 100-1000 times dimmer than an afternoon on Earth, which is similar to the viewing conditions of a thick smog or dense fire smoke. The sunsets on Titan are expected to be \u0026ldquo;underwhelming events\u0026rdquo;, where the Sun disappears about half-way up in the sky (50° above the horizon) with no distinct change in color. After that, the sky will slowly darken until it reaches night. However, the surface is expected to remain as bright as the full Moon up to 1 Earth-day after sunset.\nFor reference on the luminosity levels: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/ Outdoor light levels were much higher (11,080\u0026ndash;18,176 lux) than indoors (112\u0026ndash;156 lux). The higher lux levels protective of myopia (\u0026gt;1000 lux) were measured at the tree shade (5556\u0026ndash;7876 lux) and with hat (4112\u0026ndash;8156 lux). [\u0026hellip;] illuminance levels reaching 130,000 lux on a clear day to 15,000 lux under shaded or cloudy conditions.\nSaturn\u0026rsquo;s visibility From \u0026ldquo;Saturn\u0026rsquo;s Moon Titan: From 4. 5 Billion Years Ago to the Present - an Insight Into the Workings and Exploration of the Most Earth-Like World in the Outer Solar System\u0026rdquo;, Ralph Lorenz https://books.google.pt/books?id=xyNRygEACAAJ\u0026redir_esc=y In visible light, Saturn will make the sky on Titan\u0026rsquo;s Saturn-facing side appear slightly brighter, similar to an overcast night with a full moon on Earth. Saturn\u0026rsquo;s rings are hidden from view owing to the alignment of Titan\u0026rsquo;s orbital plane and the plane of the rings. Saturn is expected to show phases, akin to the phases of Venus on Earth, that partially illuminate the surface of Titan at night, except for eclipses.\nFrom NASA\u0026rsquo;s simulator https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/ , 90° aperture:\nMagnetosphere Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn\u0026rsquo;s magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.\nTitan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours.\nSo 5% should be the time spent exposed to solar wind, which amounts to (0.05 * 16 * 24) = 19h every two weeks.\nI find everywhere mentions to the fact that Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface is not strongly radioactive, but I can\u0026rsquo;t find references or explanations, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say whether it\u0026rsquo;s lack of data or not, whether it\u0026rsquo;s due to its atmosphere or Saturn\u0026rsquo;s magnetosphere or whatnot. :(\nAtmosphere Color External layers are dark, UV blue, internal layers are yellow-orange due to the presence of tolines.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/50320802233/in/photostream/ Processed using calibrated red, green, and blue filtered images of Titan taken by Cassini on November 19 2007.

Gill\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/50343380682/in/photostream/ Processed using calibrated red, green, blue, and ultraviolet filtered images taken by Cassini on June 18 2014. The blue image is only used on a small part to colorize the star at the top left. The rest of the image uses UV in the blue channel. [\u0026hellip;] NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/CICLOPS/Kevin M. Gill\nWeather and Climate Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface temperature is about 94 K (-179.2C). At this temperature, water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere. Titan receives about 1% as much sunlight as Earth. Before sunlight reaches the surface, about 90% has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere, leaving only 0.1% of the amount of light Earth receives.\nThere seem to be clearly a complex weather system on Titan, very similar to Earth\u0026rsquo;s, with a \u0026ldquo;methane cycle\u0026rdquo; similar to the water cycle on Earth. However, is often unclear what pictures are taken in visible light and what in infrared, because due to Titan\u0026rsquo;s haze opacity to visible light, most images default to infrared without telling.\nClouds https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18420 This animated sequence of Cassini images shows methane clouds moving above the large methane sea on Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Titan known as Ligeia Mare. The spacecraft captured the views between July 20 and July 22, 2014, as it departed Titan following a flyby. Cassini tracked the system of clouds as it developed and dissipated over Ligeia Mare during this two-day period. Measurements of the cloud motions indicate wind speeds of around 7 to 10 miles per hour (3 to 4.5 meters per second).\nThe timing between exposures in the sequence varies. In particular, there is a 17.5-hour jump between the second and third frames. Most other frames are separated by one to two hours. A separate view, PIA18421, shows the location of these clouds relative to features in Titan\u0026rsquo;s north polar region.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18421 As NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini spacecraft sped away from Titan following a relatively close flyby, its cameras monitored the moon\u0026rsquo;s northern polar region, capturing signs of renewed cloud activity.\nCassini scientists noted a decrease in clouds everywhere on Titan after a large storm in 2010, and expected clouds to return sooner, based on computer models of Titan\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere. Continued monitoring should help them determine if the clouds\u0026rsquo; appearance signals the beginning of summer weather patterns, or if it is an isolated occurrence.\nA streak of methane clouds is seen here, near center, over the large methane sea known as Ligeia Mare. A movie sequence, PIA18420, shows these clouds in motion over a two-day period.\nSand storms Article: Observational evidence for active dust storms on Titan at equinox, S. Rodriguez et al, 2018 ( here )\nSurface The only close-up surface image of Titan, from the Huygens lander (real color for what I know).\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07232 This image was returned yesterday, January 14, 2005, by the European Space Agency\u0026rsquo;s Huygens probe during its successful descent to land on Titan. This is the colored view, following processing to add reflection spectra data, and gives a better indication of the actual color of the surface. Initially thought to be rocks or ice blocks, they are more pebble-sized. The two rock-like objects just below the middle of the image are about 15 centimeters (about 6 inches) (left) and 4 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) (center) across respectively, at a distance of about 85 centimeters (about 33 inches) from Huygens. The surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice. There is also evidence of erosion at the base of these objects, indicating possible fluvial activity.\nhttps://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08119 This poster shows a set of images acquired by the European Space Agency\u0026rsquo;s Huygens probe descent imager/spectral radiometer, in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), at five different altitudes above Titan\u0026rsquo;s surface. The images were taken on Jan. 14, 2005.\nLakes https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20021 These images from the Radar instrument aboard NASA\u0026rsquo;s Cassini spacecraft show the evolution of a transient feature in the large hydrocarbon sea named Ligeia Mare on Saturn\u0026rsquo;s moon Titan. Analysis by Cassini scientists indicates that the bright features, informally known as the \u0026quot;magic island,\u0026quot; are a phenomenon that changes over time. They conclude that the brightening is due to either waves, solids at or beneath the surface or bubbles, with waves thought to be the most likely explanation. They think tides, sea level and seafloor changes are unlikely to be responsible for the brightening.\nThe images in the column at left show the same region of Ligeia Mare as seen by Cassini\u0026rsquo;s radar during flybys in (from top to bottom) 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The bottom image was acquired by Cassini on Jan. 11, 2015, and adds another snapshot in time as Cassini continues to monitor the ephemeral feature (previously highlighted in PIA18430). The feature is apparent in the images from 2013 and 2014, but it is not present in other images of the region. assini has observed similar transient features elsewhere in Ligeia Mare, and also in Kraken Mare (see PIA19047). These features are the first instances of active processes in Titan\u0026rsquo;s lakes and seas to be confirmed by multiple detections. Their changing nature demonstrates that Titan\u0026rsquo;s seas are not stagnant, but rather, dynamic environments.\nThe Cassini radar team plans to re-observe this particular region of Ligeia Mare one more time during Cassini\u0026rsquo;s final close flyby of Titan in April 2017. The results may further illuminate the phenomenon responsible for the appearance of the transient features. The large image panel shows Ligeia Mare in its entirety. Ligeia is Titan\u0026rsquo;s second-largest liquid hydrocarbon sea, and has a total area of about 50,000 square miles (130,000 square kilometers), making it 50 percent larger than Lake Superior on Earth. This panel is a mosaic of five synthetic aperture radar images acquired by Cassini between 2007 and 2014. It shows a region approximately 330 by 305 miles (530 by 490 kilometers) in area.\n[\u0026hellip;] The images have been colorized and processed for aesthetic appeal.\n",
