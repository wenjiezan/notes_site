  <caption>Ausonia and Urania</caption>
  <note>These images have been captured with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument on ESOâ€™s Very Large Telescope as part of a programme that surveyed 42 of the largest asteroids in our Solar System. They show Ausonia and Urania, the two smallest objects imaged, each approximately 90 kilometres in diameter.</note>
